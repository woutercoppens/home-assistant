Copy the Client ID and Client secret as you'll need it to configure the integration in Home Assistant.

### 2. Install Home Assistant Core

See [Home Assistant Official Installation Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) to install Home Assistant Core.

### 3. Install the custom integration

!!! HACS will be added in a later phase, please copy the custom_components folder for now !!!

Option 1: Copy Method
  1. Download the [openmotics-home-assistant repo](https://github.com/openmotics/home-assistant).
  2. Unzip it and copy the `custom_components/openmotics` folder to the Home Assistant configuration directory, for example `~/.homeassistant`.

  The disadvantage of a manual installation is that you won't be notified about updates.

  2. See [Initial Configuration Guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/configuration/basic) and complete initial configuration.

Make sure you restart Home Assistant after the installation (in HACS). After the restart, go to **Configuration** in the side menu in Home Assistant and select **Integrations**. Click on **Add Integrations** in the bottom right corner and search for **Openmotics** to install. This will open the configuration menu with the default settings.
